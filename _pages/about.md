I'm Evan Lewis, a graduate researcher and radio astronomer at West Virginia University. I study pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts using data from radio telescopes all over the world, and participate in all-sky radio surveys on the Green Bank and Arecibo Telescopes. Working with Dr. Maura McLaughlin as my doctoral supervisor, I've worked on a number of pulsar timing projects including the timing of binary millisecond pulsars discovered with Arecibo, multifrequency radio observations of the radio magnetar _Swift_ J1818--1607, and timing transient, RRAT-like pulsars discovered with the Green Bank Telescope. 

I am also a passionate and energetic science communicator! As a graduate student I helped to run the [WVU Planetarium](https://planetarium.wvu.edu/), where I developed content and gave presentations to public audiences, school groups, and private events of all types. When the pandemic hit two months into my position, we transitioned to provide two virtual shows per week given over Zoom, as well as virtual field trips. I wrote for the [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) collaboration for two years, translating new astrophysics research papers into accessible summaries for the general public. You can see all of my published articles [here](https://astrobites.org/author/elewis/). I have also been invited to speak at a number of amateur astronomy groups; [here is a recording](https://youtu.be/J6ofQ6pzGro) of a talk I gave to the East Brunswick Astronomy Club in June 2025.
